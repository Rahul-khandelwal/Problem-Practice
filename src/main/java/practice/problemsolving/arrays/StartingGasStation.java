/**
 * https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/gas-station/
 *
 * There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at
 * station i is gas[i].
 *
 * You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to
 * travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with
 * an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
 *
 * Return the minimum starting gas stationâ€™s index if you can travel around the
 * circuit once, otherwise return -1.
 *
 * You can only travel in one direction. i to i+1, i+2, ... n-1, 0, 1, 2..
 * Completing the circuit means starting at i and ending up at i again.
 *
 * Example :
 *
 * Input : Gas : [1, 2] Cost : [2, 1]
 *
 * Output : 1
 *
 * If you start from index 0, you can fill in gas[0] = 1 amount of gas. Now your
 * tank has 1 unit of gas. But you need cost[0] = 2 gas to travel to station 1.
 * If you start from index 1, you can fill in gas[1] = 2 amount of gas. Now your
 * tank has 2 units of gas. You need cost[1] = 1 gas to get to station 0. So,
 * you travel to station 0 and still have 1 unit of gas left over. You fill in
 * gas[0] = 1 unit of additional gas, making your current gas = 2. It costs you
 * cost[0] = 2 to get to station 1, which you do and complete the circuit.
 *
 * NOTE That this question can also be solved using sliding window, try that
 * later.
